# WhatsApp Payment Integration

This e-commerce application includes WhatsApp integration for payment confirmation after orders are placed.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Your WhatsApp Business Number

Edit the file `/frontend/src/config/whatsapp.js` and update your business WhatsApp number:

```javascript
export const WHATSAPP_CONFIG = {
  // Replace with your actual WhatsApp business number
  businessNumber: "+2348123456789", // Example: Nigeria number

  // You can also customize business name
  businessName: "CodVeda Clothing Shop",
};
```

### 2. WhatsApp Number Format
